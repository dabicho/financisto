THIS IS A FORK FROM THE FINANCE ANDROID APPLICATION FINANCISTO.  
Reason for me forking it, I want to do something with it as I intend to move away from my current choice for finance app as it seems to be stagnant and when I used financisto I didn't get a good handle of it and found it missing some features, like some reports.
Following the original readme from the time I forked.
